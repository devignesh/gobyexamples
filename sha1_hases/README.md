SHA1 hashes are frequently used to compute short identities for binary or text blobs. For example, the git revision control system uses SHA1s extensively to identify versioned files and directories.
You can compute other hashes using a similar pattern to the one shown above. For example, to compute MD5 hashes import crypto/md5 and use md5.New().
